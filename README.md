## Introduction

Over the last few months, **Angie Berry's Store** has been getting so many customers, they don’t know what to do with themselves! Our team asked Angie to give us as much data as possible so we could familiarize ourselves with their current operations and come up with a strategic plan.

## About the Dataset
They provided us with the following csv files; 
- Transaction_report: A list of the last 100,000 transactions, as of 8/19/2019 some time in the afternoon.  This file includes a transaction id that is unique to every customer’s settlement at one of the store’s registers. If a customer has a loyalty card, they scan it during a transaction and their customer id is also recorded here.  Every line includes a product id and a quantity.  Lastly, there is a timestamp called paid_at that says the time the transaction was settled.
- Loyalty_customers:	A list of all loyalty customers’ names and ids.  Angie was unable to send us the file that shows each user’s total points earned but told us that every customer earns 2 points for every dollar spent.  They can be redeemed for special items and future purchases. Each point is worth $0.01.
- Products: A list of all twelve products that Angie’s Berry Corner currently sells. The file includes the product’s id, name, price and quantity unit.
- Employees: A list of all ten employees that worked during the timeframe captured in transaction_report.csv.  If the employee quit or was fired, they will have an end date in addition to the start date that all employees have.  Unfortunately, the transaction report doesn’t contain any information pertaining to the employee operating the transaction. something I have already suggested they add moving forward, for the sake of tracking employee’ performance.
